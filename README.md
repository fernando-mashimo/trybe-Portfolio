# trybe-Portfolio

This repository contains some of the Main Projects delivered during my Web Development course at Trybe (https://www.betrybe.com/).

All of them may be cloned into a local machine - install all dependencies by running the command 'npm install' once it has been downloaded.
Check 'packages.json' files to know a little more about the dependencies.
